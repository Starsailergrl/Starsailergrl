- 👋 Hi, I’m @Starsailergrl
I'm from Australia and female.
- 👀 I’m interested in Kali, pen testing and am fascinated with data and accessing it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything from scratch. There are so many things to do so
 nothing is left out and I'm sure I barely even have a grasp on the capabilities of the 
tools. I began this journey due to my inability to get back into the Gmail account that 
has 20yrs of photos on it. I'm still not in yet but I am determined that eventually I will lol..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bug bounties, pen testing opportunities from a business 
perspective. I've started hackthebox and watch network chuck and John Hammond do far. Perhaps
 I'll take their advice and start a blog about my learning. To learn by teaching... Interesting
- 📫 How to reach me is via Wickr frankiefeinder
